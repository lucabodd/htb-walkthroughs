# htb-walkthroughs
HTB walkthroughs for both active and retired machines

## Quality of life standards
we should create a .md file for each machine.
each file must be titled with the name of the machine.
each file must contain two paragraphs:

* user: marked with ##
* root: marked with ##

screenshots or any kind of additional documentation that ease the understanding of the processes/tools/technologies used are welcome and strongly reccomended.

## Luv the "you" of the future
If a tool used for exploiting a machine is tricky, difficult or for any reason it's use is not straight forward, please document it's usage [here]
