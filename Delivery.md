As we can see only three ports are opened 22, 80, 8065.  
Now lets dig into port 8065.  
Here we can find a 'mattermost' login page. The site is asking for credentials, but we have none. At a fist glance we can notice that we can register an account, but after ginving the email in the registration form and completing the submission, we see a message like 'a message has been sent to your email, please verify your address'.  
Since we do not have an email and the mail server/network is configured to send email only to certain domains, we cannot verify the email address, hence, we need to poke around to find any usable email.  
Let's now dig into port 80.  
as we open the page we can see a button that redirects us to helpdesk.delivery.htb. here we can find a trouble ticketing platform called 'osTicket', since no obvoius exploit can be found, let's dig into how the system works.  
We can try to open a new ticket, and as we open the ticket we can notice the following success message:  
![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220530223904.png)
as we can see the ticketing system created a new email address @delivery.htb. If we want to add some comments to the case we can mail directly this address.  

## User
Now that we have an email address @delivery.htb we can use the newly created address on mattermost, so that we should receive the verification token on this email and we will be able to grab this token by seeing the comments added to the ticket: 
![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220530224335.png)
Now we can copy and paste the verification token and log in to mattermost.  
As we get in into mattermost we can instantly look a the comments in the 'Internal' channel.  
![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220530224508.png)
Here we can find the credential: `maildeliverer:Youve_G0t_Mail!` and also we can find two big hints.  
Now, if we try to use this credentials for SSH we got a shell as user maildeliverer
```bash
[root@kali Delivery ]$ ssh -l maildeliverer $TARGET

## Root
### Method 1 - Sucrack
Once we log in, following the previously discovered suggestion, we can try to use [hashcat to generate a wordlist](https://infinitelogins.com/2020/11/16/using-hashcat-rules-to-create-custom-wordlists/) based on the suggested password 'PleaseSubscribe!' and give this wordlist to sucrack in order to try to crack system accounts.  
To generate the dictionary we can use the following `hashcat` command:  
```bash
[root@kali Delivery ]$ hashcat pass_reuse.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule --stdout > passwords.txt 
```
`pass_reuse.txt`  file, obviously contains, as only entry `PleaseSubscribe!` . 
the rule file `/usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule` does a permutaion of the given password.  
Now that we have a dictionary we can use `sucrack`.  
Unfortunately, we cannot compile `sucrack` offline and ship and execute only the binary, since the compiler is complaining about some `gcc` dependencies.  
So we need to create an archive, upload the `sucrack` folder and compile it directly into the target machine.  
Once `sucrack` is ready, we can use sucrack against local accounts.  
```bash
maildeliverer@Delivery:/dev/shm/.work/sucrack/src$ ./sucrack passwords.txt                                            
166/1177                                                   
password is: PleaseSubscribe!21  
```
`sucrack` doesn't tell us for wich account password cracking was successful, so hoping the best of luck let's try to su as root:  
```bash
maildeliverer@Delivery:/dev/shm/.work/sucrack/src$ su -    
Password:                                                  
root@Delivery:~#   
```

### Method 2 - MySQL Hash Dump
Once we log in, as always we can llok around for possible configuration files that disclose credentials.  
We can start by looking into mattermost:  
```bash
maildeliverer@Delivery:~$ find / -name mattermost 2>/dev/null
/opt/mattermost
/opt/mattermost/bin/mattermost
/var/lib/mysql/mattermost
```
Now we can look int `/opt/mattermost` and see what we can find.  
as we change directory we can find a `config/` directory containing a `config.json` file which look very promising.  
Looking into the file, we can see the following credentials for mysql database:  
```json
"SqlSettings": {
        "DriverName": "mysql",
        "DataSource": "mmuser:Crack_The_MM_Admin_PW@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/mattermost?charset=utf8mb4,utf8\u0026readTimeout=30s\u0026writeTimeout=30s",
        "DataSourceReplicas": [],
        "DataSourceSearchReplicas": [],
        "MaxIdleConns": 20,
        "ConnMaxLifetimeMilliseconds": 3600000,
        "MaxOpenConns": 300,
        "Trace": false,
        "AtRestEncryptKey": "n5uax3d4f919obtsp1pw1k5xetq1enez",
        "QueryTimeout": 30,
        "DisableDatabaseSearch": false
	}
```
Now we can login into mysql with `mmuser:Crack_The_MM_Admin_PW` 
```bash
maildeliverer@Delivery:/opt/mattermost/config:~$ mysql -u mmuser -p -D mattermost                                                
Enter password:

As we can see we get a bunch of hashes.  
These hashes are in a bcrypt format. bcrypt is based on blowfish and might be tough to crack wit rockyou.  
Now, to reduce the number of attempts, we can follow the int found on mattermost and generate a dictionary using the following `hashcat` command:  
```bash
[root@kali Delivery ]$ hashcat pass_reuse.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule --stdout > passwords.txt 
```
Now that we have a dictionary we can try to crack the hash using `john`
```
[root@kali Delivery ]$ john --wordlist=passwords.txt hash.txt                   
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (bcrypt [Blowfish 32/64 X3])

Now, hoping the best of luck let's try to su as root:
